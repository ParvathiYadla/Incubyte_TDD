# Incubyte_TDD
Assesement for Incubyte TDD task


This implementation follows the TDD approach and includes the necessary logic to handle different delimiters, new lines between numbers, and negative numbers.

 It throws an IllegalArgumentException when negative numbers are encountered. The test cases should be implemented using a testing framework like JUnit to ensure the functionality is working as expected.
